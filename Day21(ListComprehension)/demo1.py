# list comprehension

# List comprehension - It provides a shorter syntax, to create a new list based on an existing list
# syntax : [Expression for item in iterable]

# print numbers from 1 to 10 and put it in a list
# general for loop where we append items into a new list

# new_list = []
# for i in range(1,11):
#     new_list.append(i)
#
# print(new_list)
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# List comprehension
l1 = [n for n in range(1,11)]
print(l1)
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
