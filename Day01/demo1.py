# Jyupiter

# High Level Language(HLL) - Human understandable language
# Binary or Machine Language - Which a computer can understand. It has 0s and 1s

# Trnslators - Converts HLL to Machine language
# There are 2 types of Translators:
# 1. Compilers - Reads the full block of code and executes(compiles). If there are any errors, 
# it will give error message, else it will go ahead and convert HLL to machine language
# Ex: Java, C#, C++

# 2. Interpreters - Reads the code line by line and if there are any errors, it will give error message 
# immediately in the same line, else it will go ahead and convert HLL to machine language
# Ex: Python, Javascript, Perl

# variable: A variable is a container/place holder to hold a value at a time
# a = 10
# print(a)
# 10

# Dynalmically/automatic typed language
# int a = 10
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax

# print() - is a inbuilt method which prints the value inside it(inside the brackets). In the above print(), 
# I am printing the value of a.
# syntax: print(a)
print() #prints an empty line

a = 10
print(a)
