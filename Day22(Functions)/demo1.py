# Functions :
# There are two types of functions :
# 1).Pre-defined functions
# Examples : print(),sum(),max(),min().........
# 2).User Defined Functions

# What is function ?
# Python Functions is a block of statements that return the specific task.
# The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done tasks together and make a function
# so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs,

# To define user function by using def keyword

# def functionName():
#     statement...1
#     statement...2
#     statement...N
# FunctionName()

# Example:
def message():
    print('Hello World')


message()
# Hello World
